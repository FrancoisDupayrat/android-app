# Echopen Android App

This android app aims to show medical image from an echopen (or other ?)
ultrasound device. See more about this project on [echopen's
wiki](http://echopen.org)

## Installation (for Developers)

As an android app, you need to have a java JDK installed.
We use [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) as builder tools. You need to install it
too.
Before being able to build the app, you need to specify, in a local.properties file, in the root folder, the Android SDK and NDK location, with sdk.dir and ndk.dir, example:

	sdk.dir=/Path/To/Your/.../Android/sdk
	ndk.dir=/Path/To/Your/.../android-ndk-r10e

After, you can launch the Gradle wrapper from the project directory, example:

Mac/Linux
	
	./gradlew assembleDebug
	
Windows

	gradlew.bat assembleDebug
	

To install on a device:

* Switch the Android device to dev mode (generally, tap 7 times on "Version number" in parameters)
* Enable USB debugging
* Connect the device to your computer (with screen unlocked to see the prompt)
* Accept the prompt on your device, to authorize your computer
* Launch gradlew with `installDebug`

Note: It seems that we use android-sdk 19 but current android-sdk version is 24
    now...

## How to contribute

Report a bug, ask for features, for all of this, we use [Github issues](https://github.com/echopen/android-app/issues)

You can clone the projet, add something or fix a bug and make a pull request. We
try to read them quick as possible.

## Challenges and To Dos

### Mockups 
  To drive your code, here's the MOCKUP that we have set with medical doctors, engineers and designers.

### Testing Data

  A lots of tools enable you to test and play with the data : 
  
  
  *Simulating real data*
  
  You'll find in the [kit-soft](https://github.com/echopen/kit-soft/) repo, you'll find some real data file [raw_data.txt](https://github.com/echopen/kit-soft/tree/master/data) that was output by our hardware suite.
  
  In this repo, you'll find all the tools to install in local a `UDP` server that can simulate a real time data coming from our hardware.    
  
  *Simulating fake but medical data*

  You'll find in `phantom/img_kydney.txt` and `phantom/img_obs.txt` the data that is output from the Hardware. The goal is to build and obtain from each of these double arrays the images stored respectively as `phantom/img_kydney.bmp` and `phantom/img_obs.bmp`.

  The image `img_kydney.bmp` is more realistic than `img_obs.bmp`.

   *Simulating with a plain `JAVA` app*
   
   In the `phantom/test_data` directory, you'll find a plain `JAVA` app that lets you test and taste the data without the hassle of bothering with `Android` configuration and other heaviness. 


  `phantom/img_kydney.txt` and `phantom/img_obs.txt` corresponds to the raw signal that needs to be filtered. They serve as basis for the envelope detection from which pixels intensity are deduced. ** The resulting pixel file sits in `data_kydney.csv`**


### Image Processing *this is exploratory*

  EchOpen will rely on `BoofCV` library as main image processing tool. It is pure `JAVA` libraries, contrary to the well-known `OpenCV`, which is `c/c++` library. 

  As specified in the `BoofCV` doc, one have to turn the images - say for instance bitmap image - in `ImageUInt8` or `ImageFloat32` class in order to use simply `BoofCV`

  ```
  File image = new File($ultrasound_file);
  Bitmap bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(image.getAbsolutePath());
  ImageUInt8 boofcv_image = ConvertBitmap.bitmapToGray(bitmap, (ImageUInt8) null, null);
  ```

  for those interested, here's a [link](http://boofcv.org/index.php?title=Performance:OpenCV:BoofCV) to find OpenCV vs. BoofCV performance benchmark. As said there, `OpenCV` seems better on low level operations but `BoofCV` seems better on most of high level operations. 

  The client does not worry about `BootCV` Images class, they are instanciated from `BaseImage`. Then client throws to image processor class an `ImageView` and gets backs a `BitMap` class. Any filter must inherit from `BaseProcess`. For instance, the app implements this kind of code corresponding to a wavelette denoising treatment. 

  ```
  WaveletDenoise waveletDenoise = new WaveletDenoise(image);
  waveletDenoise.denoise();
  bitmap = waveletDenoise.getBitmap();
  ```

  Processing can take a long time. It is recommended to wrap it in an `AsyncTask` !
